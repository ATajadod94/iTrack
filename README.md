iTrack is a set of Matlab scripts for dealing with eye tracking data from EyeLink eye trackers.

Using the iTrack data type, you can import directly from edf files, merge with behavioral data, and do lots of common functions associated with examining fixations and with pupil dilation. 


An example script can be found in 'example' along with some data to work with. 

More documentation will be added soon.
